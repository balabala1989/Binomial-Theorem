# Binomial-Theorem

### What it does?
	
	A simple app that calculates binomial theorem.
	In elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. 
	According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial (x + y)n into a sum involving terms of the form ax^by^c, 
	where the exponents b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c = n, and the coefficient a of each term is a specific positive integer depending on n and b. 
	
	For example (for n = 4),
	(x+y)^{4}=x^{4}+4x^{3}y+6x^{2}y^{2}+4xy^{3}+y^{4}
